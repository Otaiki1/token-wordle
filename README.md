## Inspiration

_The inspiration behind this projects was to deliver an amazing game play with a very unique popular game, with amazing rewards to keep players glued while playing. so you earn while you play but in much better way._

## What it does

_Token Wordle is a unique puzzle game that allows for exciting gameplay mechanics and rewards. Similar to Wordle, players can earn tokens for each game they play and win, and these tokens can be staked for a set period of time to earn even more tokens as they play._

_As players progress through the game, they have the chance to earn several milestone rewards by achieving specific milestones such as solving challenging puzzles or reaching high scores. These tokenized rewards can then be cashed out as airtime._

_To encourage friendly competition, Token Wordle features a leaderboard that displays the top players based on their token holdings and high scores. Players can see their own ranking on the leaderboard and strive to climb the ranks by playing more games and winning more tokens._

_Overall, Token Wordle provides a fun and engaging puzzle experience while also allowing players to earn tokens that have real value._

## How we built it

Africastalking API was used to enhance the airtime payment , a demo can be seen when the number used to register is linked with the sandbox . the ui was built with next-js 13 for smooth routing and speed. **check out link** [link](https://token-wordle.vercel.app/) and **Github link** [link](https://github.com/Otaiki1/token-wordle).


## What's next for Token Wordle
we hope to keep building after the hackathon by adding multiple games to the build and making reward system better

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
